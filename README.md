# Classifying Cat Meows
## Harvard University Spring 2024 
### Final Project for Introduction to Data Science 2 (AC209B)

Pets are known as a manâ€™s best friend. 66% of U.S. households own a pet and yet many people have no way of understanding their pets emotions. Through our project, we will focus specifically on cats and understanding what their different meows mean. We will focus on ten different emotions a cat can display through their meows: angry, defense, fighting, happy, hunting mind, mating, mother call, paining, resting, warning.

The goal of this project is to see how well we can classify the emotions of cat meows based on a set of approximately 5,000 training audio files.
